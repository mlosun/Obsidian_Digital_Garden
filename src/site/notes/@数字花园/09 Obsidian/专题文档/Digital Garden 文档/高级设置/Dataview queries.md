The plugin supports publishing dataview query result. Simply publish a page containing a query. The plugin will render the result as it is at the time of publishing. If the result changes, you will need to republish that note.

It supports all query types: dataview, dataviewjs, inline dataview and inline dataviewjs.

As the plugin "freezes" the result and publishes it, you'll actually even see the links from a dataview query as backlinks. 

You need to have version 0.5.39 or later of the dataview plugin installed for this to work.
